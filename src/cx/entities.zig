//! `cx.entities` — entity creation and access.
//!
//! This module hosts the bodies of the entity-related helpers that
//! used to live directly on `Cx`. They are accessed through the
//! `cx.entities.<name>(...)` sub-namespace, which is implemented as a
//! zero-sized field on `Cx` whose methods recover `*Cx` via
//! `@fieldParentPtr`. See `lists.zig` for the rationale.
//!
//! ## Naming inside the namespace
//!
//! The redundant `Entity` suffix is dropped now that the namespace
//! carries the grouping:
//!
//! | Old                                  | New                             |
//! | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
//! | `cx.createEntity(T, value)`          | `cx.entities.create(T, value)`  |
//! | `cx.readEntity(T, entity)`           | `cx.entities.read(T, entity)`   |
//! | `cx.writeEntity(T, entity)`          | `cx.entities.write(T, entity)`  |
//! | `cx.entityCx(T, entity)`             | `cx.entities.context(T, entity)`|
//! | `cx.attachEntityCancelGroup(id, g)`  | `cx.entities.attachCancel(id, g)` |
//! | `cx.detachEntityCancelGroup(id)`     | `cx.entities.detachCancel(id)`  |
//!
//! The original top-level methods remain as deprecated one-line
//! forwarders into this module — they will be removed in PR 9.
//!
//! Process-wide cancel-group registration (not tied to an entity)
//! stays on `Cx` itself as `cx.registerCancelGroup` /
//! `cx.unregisterCancelGroup`. Those have nothing to do with entity
//! lifetime — they are app-level groups cancelled at window close.
